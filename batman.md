BATMAN is an R package for estimating metabolite concentrations from Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectral data using a specialised MCMC algorithm. It deconvolutes peaks from 1-dimensional NMR spectra, automatically assigns them to specific metabolites from a target list and obtains concentration estimates. The Bayesian model incorporates information on characteristic peak patterns of metabolites and is able to account for shifts in the position of peaks commonly seen in NMR spectra of biological samples. It applies a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to sample from a joint posterior distribution of the model parameters and obtains concentration estimates with reduced error compared with conventional numerical integration and comparable to manual deconvolution by experienced spectroscopists.
